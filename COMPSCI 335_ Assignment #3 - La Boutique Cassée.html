   </h2>
   <h3>
      Background
   </h3>
   <p>
      La Boutique Cassée is an online shop selling books and blurays. The shop uses a
      service-oriented architecture with a customer-facing UI front-end, and a service
      back-end. The service back-end consists of two separate services and associated
      RESTful interfaces.
   </p>
   <p>
      One of the services is open to all, and allows the user to browse and search through
      the shop. It also allows a user to place and view comments on the shop, as well
      as to register at the shop. The other service is only for registered users and this
      allows purchasing of items. Registered users are required to authenticate before
      using this service.

   <h3>
      Consuming the Service - Building a UI
   </h3>
   <p>
      An online version of the two services supporting the shop are available at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc
      </a> and <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc
      </a>. Both services
      provide auto-generated help explaining the REST APIs they support.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         The API doc for the open service is available at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help">
            http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help
         </a>
      </li>
      <li>
         The API doc for the closed service is available at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help">
            http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help
         </a>. While the API doc
         for the open service is publicly accessible, the API doc for the closed service
         is accessible only for registered users. To access this doc, you need to first register
         yourself using the open service. Alternatively, the shop already has a user named
         <em>bond007</em> whose password is <em>bond007passwd</em>, and you can pose as
         this user.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Please study the service carefully, using the API doc and by experimentation. You
      can experiment using your browser and the inspection tools available with your browser
      (e.g., <em>Web Inspector</em> on Safari, <a href="https://getfirebug.com/"><em>Firebug</em></a>
      on Firefox, or <em>F12</em> on Chrome and IE). You may also wish to use HTTP debugging
      tools such as <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci215s1c/resources/mano/W3Client-MacOS-10_10-x64.zip">
         W3Client (MacOS)
      </a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci215s1c/resources/mano/W3Client.exe">
         W3Client (Windows)
      </a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      You are then asked to develop the customer-facing UI front-end using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      It is recommended that this UI is a single-page app (i.e., using a single HTML page).
      There are three logical sections in the UI: (1) viewing the items being sold (books and blurays),
      (2) viewing and leaving comments, and (3) user registration. The UI need to be functional and
      clean, but does not have to be pretty. Screenshots of a sample UI are provided <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci335s2c/assignments/mano/ScreenShots/">
         here
      </a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The closed service at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc
      </a> uses HTTP's digest authentication. Another instance of this service using
      HTTP's basic authentication is available at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed2/Service.svc">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed2/Service.svc
      </a>.
      These two services may help you to experiment with the differences between the two authentication mechanisms.
      Note again that the two service instances are identical except for their use of the authentication.
   </p>
   <h3>
      Pen-Testing the Service
   </h3>
   <p>
      It is thought the service has a number of vulnerabilities. You are now asked to
      penetration-test the service, and report your findings. You will first assume the
      role of a network user who is able connect to the service with the view of injecting
      code. You will then assume the role of a co-located user with access to the data
      to give more insight into further potential vulnerabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
      For this part, you will use local versions of the services and data. To this end,
      please download copies of the open service, the closed service, and the data first.
      You also need to change the <em>Web.config</em> files in the two services to point
      to the local location where you have saved the data.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&cname=OpenBC">
            Open Service
         </a>. Unzip the service and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\A3\Open</em>.
         You can then run the service using the following command line:<br>
         <em>"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\A3\Open</em><br>
         <br>
         If you want to run IIS Express from a Windows PowerShell, you need to prefix the above command line with &amp;
         so that PowerShell can execute the command (rather than treating the command as a string):<br>
         <em>&amp; "C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8188 /path:H:\335\A3\Open</em><br>
         <br>
         Test the service by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/help">
            http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/help
         </a>. The browser is expected to show the
         API doc you saw at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help">
            http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Open/Service.svc/help
         </a>. Stop the service
         by quitting IIS Express.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&cname=ClosedBC">
            Closed Service
         </a>. Unzip the service and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\A3\Closed</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/CWS/CourseWorkService.svc/cwm?cid=BinDispatch&cname=DataBC">
            Data
         </a>. Unzip the data and place it in a folder such as <em>H:\335\A3\BoutiqueCasseeData</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Now open the Web.config files in the two services, and find the line:
         <br>
         &lt;add key="DataRoot" value="C:/WebRoot/BoutiqueCasseeData/"/&gt;<br>
         Change the value field to reflect where you saved the data. E.g., <em>H:\335\A3\BoutiqueCasseeData</em>.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Now start the open service using IIS Express. If the data and the
      open service are correctly set up, you should see a list of bluray titles when you
      point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/brlist">http://localhost:8188/Service.svc/brlist</a>.
      Note that the output shown in the browser may not be well-formatted, and in this
      case, you may wish to view the source to see the unformatted content.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can test the closed service using the following command line:<br>
      <em>"C:\Program Files\IIS Express\IISExpress.exe" /port:8189 /path:H:\335\A3\Closed</em><br>
      Test the service by pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8189/Service.svc/help">
         http://localhost:8189/Service.svc/help
      </a>. The browser is expected to show the
      API doc you saw at <a href="http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help">
         http://redsox.tcs.auckland.ac.nz/BC/Closed/Service.svc/help
      </a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      You may find it helpful to use the UI you have already developed. This will require
      you to change the service URLs in your UI implementation to point to the local services.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please answer the questions below, first assuming the role of a network user, and
      then assuming the role of a co-located user. Where the questions require you to
      write an HTTP request, please provide a URL if the request is GET; if the request
      is POST, please provide the complete request including all the necessary HTTP headers.

      </dd>
   </dl>
   <h4>
      Co-Located User
   </h4>
   <p>
      Assume now the role of a co-located user, and answer the following questions. This
      will require you to study the data used by the services. Note that if you corrupt
      the data during your pen-testing, you can reinstate a fresh copy from what you originally
      downloaded.
   </p>
   <dl>
      <dt>C01</dt>
      <dd>
         Open the database file using a binary editor (e.g., <a href="http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/">

      </dd>
      <dt>C05</dt>
      <dd>
         In the data pack the service uses, there is a folder called <em>BluraysBig</em>,
         and the service does not use any of the images from this folder. Craft an HTTP request
         that can still give a network user access to one of the images in this folder. Write
         down this HTTP request.
      </dd>
      <dt>C06</dt>
      <dd>
         The services do not stop cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Describe in
